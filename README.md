`Transmit_Code` Isolated module for testing the XBee

Upload `REIS_Weatherbox.ino` in the Arduino IDE for the working weatherbox code. 

# Milestones

**Goal (Spring 2016):** Implementation code for weatherbox, get modular firmware by the end of the semester

1. Sensor code (integration one by one)
2. Xbee transmit code
