# Transmit Code Directory
Used to test the XBee. Contains basic operations of the tramsit module. This only tests tramsmitting hard-coded packets on each board to an XBee connected to XCTU. Requires the XBees to be configured correctly and on the same network. Also enables testing with configured sensor functions. 

# Materials

1. XCTU program
2. Arduino IDE
3. 2 XBees

# Installing Transmit Module

1. Download .zip file of Transmit_code and place libraries into the Arduino library folder
2. Run the .ino file

# Set up Arduino IDE
1. Choose correct port and choose board (Arduino UNO)

# Testing

1. Upload 
2. Once it is complete, the board will send a packet and the connected XBee attached to XCTU will be receiving the packet.
